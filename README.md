# sma(semi-major-axis)

The Semi-Major Axis (referred to as 'SMA' or 'a') is the distance from the center of an ellipse to the longer end of the ellipse. In a circle, the SMA is simply the radius. The semi-major axis determines various properties of the orbit such as orbital energy and orbital period.
